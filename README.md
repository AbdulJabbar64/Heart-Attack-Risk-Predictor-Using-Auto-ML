# Heart-Attack-Risk-Predictor-Using-Auto-ML
EvalML is an open-source AutoML library written in python that automates a large part of the machine learning process and 
we can easily evaluate which machine learning pipeline works better for the given set of data
# Automated machine learning (AutoML)?

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, 
it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. Automating the machine learning process makes it more user-friendly and 
often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms.

AutoML software platforms make machine learning more user-friendly and give organizations without a specialized data scientist or machine learning expert access to machine learning.
These platforms can be acquired from a third-party vendor, accessed through open source repositories like GitHub or built in-house.

# How does the AutoML process work?
AutoML is typically a platform or open source library that simplifies each step in the machine learning process, from handling a raw dataset to deploying a practical machine learning model. In traditional machine learning, models are developed by hand, and each step in the process must be handled separately.



AutoML automatically locates and uses the optimal type of machine learning algorithm for a given task. It does this with two concepts:

* Neural architecture search, which automates the design of neural networks. This helps AutoML models discover new architectures for problems that require them.
* Transfer learning, in which pretrained models apply what they've learned to new data sets. Transfer learning helps AutoML apply existing architectures to new problems that require it.
