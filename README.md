# Heart-Attack-Risk-Predictor-Using-Auto-ML
EvalML is an open-source AutoML library written in python that automates a large part of the machine learning process and 
we can easily evaluate which machine learning pipeline works better for the given set of data
# Automated machine learning (AutoML)?

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, 
it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. Automating the machine learning process makes it more user-friendly and 
often provides faster, more accurate outputs than hand-coded algorithms.

AutoML software platforms make machine learning more user-friendly and give organizations without a specialized data scientist or machine learning expert access to machine learning.
These platforms can be acquired from a third-party vendor, accessed through open source repositories like GitHub or built in-house.
